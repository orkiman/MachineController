Barcode File Checks Implementation Plan
====================================

1. BarcodeFile Class
   - Handles file selection (Qt file dialog)
   - Loads file content (reads lines, parses barcodes)
   - Stores barcodes in a suitable container (e.g., std::vector)

2. GUI Integration
   - Add button for file selection
   - Show selected file name/path
   - Add checkboxes for "Existence" and "Sequence" tests
   - Add selector for master communication channel

3. File Parsing Logic
   - Read file line by line
   - Parse each line as barcode
   - Store parsed barcodes in order

4. Barcode Checking Logic
   - On barcode received from communication (master):
     - If "Existence" enabled: check if barcode exists in loaded list
     - If "Sequence" enabled: check if barcode is in correct sequence

5. Result Handling
   - Provide feedback in GUI on test failures
   - Optionally log/display check results

6. Optional: Testing
   - Unit tests for file loading/parsing
   - Unit tests for existence/sequence checking logic

Step-by-step breakdown:
-----------------------
1. Design and implement BarcodeFile class
2. Integrate file selection into GUI
3. Add checkboxes and master communication selector
4. Implement barcode checking logic
5. Connect communication data to checking logic
6. Display/log results in GUI
7. (Optional) Add unit tests
